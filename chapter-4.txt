Links are created using the <a> element.
X The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate
the page you are linking to.
X If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is
best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
X You can create links to open email programs with an
email address in the "to" field.
X You can use the id attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to.
