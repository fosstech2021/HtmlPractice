The <img> element is used to add images to a 
web page.
X You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the 
source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the 
content of an image.
X You should save images at the size you will be using 
them on the web page and in the appropriate format.
X Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or 
logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs
